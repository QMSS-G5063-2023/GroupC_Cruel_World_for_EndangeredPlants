# GroupC_Cruel_World_for_EndangeredPlants


## Introduction

- Group C: Anni Dai, Lisa Yoko Carle, Raina Cheung, Vansh Murad Kalia.

- Group title: Group_C_Cruel_World_for_EndangeredPlants

- Brief description: The “Cruel World for Endangered Plants” data visualization project aims to highlight the state of endangered plants around the United States. The project seeks to provide a comprehensive view of the current state of endangered plants and the government efforts in place. Through a variety of charts, graphs, and maps, the project visualizes data on plant population trends, habitat loss, causes of endangerment, hotspots of endangered species and etc. By presenting the data in a visually engaging format, we hope to raise awareness about the urgent need to protect endangered plant species and their habitats.

## Data Description

We used ['GBIF'](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) to get data on plant species observations and converted it into a csv for our use. The csv is saved in this directory as IUCN_final and linked below. We also used _________ and _________ to get government data saved in CSVs below: (Anni to insert here)

There are __ datasets used:

| Info                  | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| [`IUCN_final`](https://github.com/QMSS-G5063-2023/GroupC_Cruel_World_for_EndangeredPlants/blob/main/data/IUCN_final.csv.zip) | Endangered Plant Specie Observations across US |
| [`GOVT Dataset`](https://github.com/QMSS-G5063-2023/GroupC_Cruel_World_for_EndangeredPlants/blob/main/data/IUCN_final.csv.zip) | Anni to incldue |

The IUCN contains the following columns that were of use to us:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| species     | chr | Scientific name of plant species |
| decimalLatitude      | int | Latitude of the observation |
| decimalLongitude   | int | Longitude of the observation |
| year| int | Year of observation |
| iucn_category        | character | IUCN Category of Plan endangement classification |

The GOVT contains the following columns that were of use to us:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| species     | chr | Scientific name of plant species |
| decimalLatitude      | int | Latitude of the observation |
