# GroupC_Cruel_World_for_EndangeredPlants


## Introduction

- Group C: Anni Dai, Lisa Yoko Carle, Raina Cheung, Vansh Murad Kalia.

- Group title: Group_C_Cruel_World_for_EndangeredPlants


## Project

- Brief description: The “Cruel World for Endangered Plants” data visualization project aims to highlight the state of endangered plants around the United States. The project seeks to provide a comprehensive view of the current state of endangered plants and the government efforts in place. Through a variety of charts, graphs, and maps, the project visualizes data on plant population trends, habitat loss, causes of endangerment, hotspots of endangered species and etc. By presenting the data in a visually engaging format, we hope to raise awareness about the urgent need to protect endangered plant species and their habitats.

## Data Description

We used ['GBIF'](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) to get data on plant species observations and converted it into a csv for our use. The csv is saved in this directory as IUCN_final and linked below. We further used a collection of different government agencies to collect total acres receiving conservation each year by different programs, total acres receiving conservation in 2022 and the practice count applied in different states, Easement Restoration trends over the years and by state, Total Obligations in millions of dollars in each year by different types of fund, total obligation of Grassland Conservation Programby year. These are saved as CSVs and defined below:

There are 6 datasets used:
